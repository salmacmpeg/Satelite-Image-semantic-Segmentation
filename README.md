# Satelite-Image-semantic-Segmentation
Satelite Image semantic Segmentation computer vision project for DSTL dataset using pythonJupyter notebook 
You should first get the dataset from here : https://www.kaggle.com/c/dstl-satellite-imagery-feature-detection/kernels
The project consists of two notebooks
Notebook 'Preprocessing of Dstl_Semantic_Segmentation.ipynb' makes necessary preprocessing for generating the dataset images as array together with their masks 
Notebook 'Dstl_Semantic_Segmentation.ipynb' makes the segmentation using different deep learning models.
